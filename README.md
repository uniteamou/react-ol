React OL is a **React component library for [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)** — bringing declarative, hook-driven mapping to your React apps.

It makes working with OpenLayers as simple as composing React components.  
Ideal for modern web mapping apps, dashboards, and GIS tools.

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 React-first API for OpenLayers maps, layers, sources, and interactions  
- 🪄 Fully typed with **TypeScript**  
- 🪶 Lightweight and **tree-shakable** (built with [Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/))  
- ⚙️ Compatible with **Vite**, **Next.js**, and **CRA**  
- 🔁 Supports map interactions (`Draw`, `Modify`, `Translate`, etc.)  
- 🧠 Designed for **Release Please** automated releases

## 🚀 Installation

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install react-ol ol ol-ext
# or with yarn
yarn add react-ol ol ol-ext
```

---

## 🧭 Getting Started

Import the core components and render your first map:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { OlMap, OlView, OlTileLayer, OlSourceOSM } from 'react-ol';
import 'ol/ol.css';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <OlMap style={{ width: '100%', height: '100vh' }}>
      <OlView center={[0, 0]} zoom={2} />
      <OlTileLayer>
        <OlSourceOSM />
      </OlTileLayer>
    </OlMap>
  );
}
```

Run your app and you should see a full interactive map powered by OpenLayers 🎉

| `<OlView>` | Sets view parameters like center, zoom, projection |
| `<OlTileLayer>` | Layer wrapper for tile sources (OSM, XYZ, etc.) |
| `<OlVectorLayer>` | Vector layer for features, geometries, and interactions |
| `<OlSourceOSM>`, `<OlSourceVector>`, `<OlSourceXYZ>` | Common data sources |
| `<OlDraw>`, `<OlModify>`, `<OlTranslate>` | Interactive tools for editing features |
| Hooks like `useOlMap`, `useOlLayer`, `useOlInteraction` | Access map context and sync state |

See the `src/` folder for all supported components.
